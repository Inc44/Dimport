An argument parsing tokenizer was created.

I discovered that parsing arguments was possible with poise.

Even more spaghetti code was eliminated.

No need for sleep as Discord is rate-limited automatically and receives all messages eventually.

Returned to custom argument parsing.

Added flags: `--no-guild`, `--no-category`, `--no-channel`, `--no-timestamp`.

Added options: `--range-start`, `--range-end`, `--first`, `--last`.

Added shorthand `--range start,end`.

---

Added `/cancel`.
