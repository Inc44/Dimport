## üéØ Motivation

[DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) supports only exporting. [Discord-Chat-Importer](https://github.com/Ethorbit/Discord-Chat-Importer) has been inactive for over two years and does not support link expiration introduced in late 2023. After creating the original version of [Dimage](https://github.com/Inc44/Dimage) in February 2025 and updating it recently, I decided to build a new alternative from scratch in Rust. It is inspired by [Discord-Chat-Importer](https://github.com/Ethorbit/Discord-Chat-Importer) in response style but includes new features and improved performance.
